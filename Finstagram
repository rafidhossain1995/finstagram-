Finstagram is a cloned application of the world wide social media app Instagram. With Finstagram, users are able to create an account, and share their pictures and allow other users to view their pictures. Along with this, users can also comment on pictures that are posted by other users. Users have the ability to go to their own profile page and see all the pictures that they have uploaded in this app. 


TECHNOLOGIES USED

BackEnd- For the Database, I chose to use Postgress. I used Express and helper packages body-parser, cors. This enabled me to create get, and post routes. The backend was then deployed to Heroku.

FrontEnd- For the frontend, I decided to use REACT. This frame wire has been set up to encompass core components with their state under each corresponding folder. For routing, I used react-router-dom to set up individual webpages as well as pass ids and classNames throughout the app. For user login and signup I decided to use Google Firebase because of their security. I also used the multer middleware to handle my data in multipart/form-data format which allows users to be able to upload pictures and set up a profile picture for themselves.
