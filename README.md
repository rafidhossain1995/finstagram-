Instagram clone

Finstagram is a cloned app based off the world known social media app Instagram. With Finstagram, a user can create an account, upload pictures and allow other users to view their pictures. These pictures can be commented and viewed by other users throughout the app. Going into the user's individual profile picture gives them the ability to upload their pictures as well as look at all the pictures they have created. 

I used frontend and backend technologies to make this app functionable. These technologies are listed below.

Backend- For the Database, I opted to use PostgreSQL. I used Express and helper packages body-parser, cors. This enabled me to create, get, and post routes. The backend was then deployed to Heroku.

Frontend- For the frontend, I decided to use REACT. This frame wire was set up to border core components with their state under each corresponding folder. For routing, I used react-router-dom that let me set up individual pages as well as pass ids and classNames throughout the app. For user login and signup I decided to used Google firebase. I also decided to use the middleware framework Multer to handle data in multipary/form-data which was used to help users have the ability to upload pictures in the app. 

I hope you all enjoy the app. Feel free to reach out for any questions, comments or concerns!
